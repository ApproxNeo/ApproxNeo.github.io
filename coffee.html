                        <li><b>Know your grind sizes.</b> Different coffee brewing contraptions require different coffee ground sizes in order to
                        extract them perfectly. Grind sizes range from fine (eg. Turkish) to coarse (eg. French Press). If unsure about the
                        size of grind your machine requires, ask your friendly local coffee shop!</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Pour some milk into your pitcher, depending on your mug size. Make sure to leave a little space for foam.</li>
                                <li>Dip the steaming wand into the pitcher, and begin steaming. Raise the tip of the wand to the top of the milk (still submerged), and aerate for a count of two.</li>
                                <li>Lower the tip back into the milk, and let milk reach 64 degrees celcius.</li>
                                <li>While waiting for the milk, use your trusty espresso machine and pull a shot or two of espresso, depending on the amount of caffeine you require.</li>
                                <li>When the milk and espresso are both ready, pour the shots into your mug.</li>
                                <li>Make sure the milk's surface is smooth and not bubbly or too foamy. In the case of excess foam, scoop some out with a spoon and swirl your milk in its pitcher to get the bubbles out.</li>
                                <li>Combine the milk with the espresso- when experienced enough, practise your latte art and create a simple heart!</li>
                                <li>Enjoy your hot, creamy latte with some of these delicious <a id="cookielink" href="pastries.html">chocolate chip cookies</a>.</li>
